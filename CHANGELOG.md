Main changes:

- Removed media controllers
  - Please check the [example project](https://github.com/erikas-taroza/simple_audio/tree/master/simple_audio_flutter/example) to see how you can implement media controllers using other packages
- Decoupled Rust code from FlutterRustBridge.
  - Allows for compatibility with other FlutterRustBridge packages that may have a different version from simple_audio. If you need this functionality, please check how [`simple_audio_flutter`](https://github.com/erikas-taroza/simple_audio/tree/master/simple_audio_flutter/rust) implements a Dart API.
- API changes

How to migrate to V2 from v1.9.0:

- `SimpleAudio.init()` no longer takes any parameters.
- `SimpleAudio()` constructor only takes one optional parameter: `shouldNormalizeVolume`
- `playbackStateStream` is renamed to `playbackState`
- `progressStateStream` is renamed to `progressState`
- Network errors are now handled by listening to the `networkError` stream
- Decode errors are now handled by listening to the `decodeError` stream
- `ProgressState` now represents time via `Duration`. To get the position in seconds, do `state.position.inSeconds`
- `seek` now takes a `Duration`. To seek to a given point in seconds, do `seek(Duration(seconds: seconds)`
- `setMetadata` and `Metadata` are removed. Please use other packages as shown in the [example](https://github.com/erikas-taroza/simple_audio/tree/master/simple_audio_flutter/example) to implement media controllers.

## 1.9.0

- Improved gapless playback
  - The preloaded file is automatically played when the current file is done playing.
